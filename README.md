How the Invisible Hand Pushes a Market Toward Equilibrium
In an Agent Based Search Model 

I am going to investigate, and simulate, an exchange economy with many agents and two goods (to begin with, maybe more later) behaves and observe if it does reach equilibrium- a point where the total utility is maximized in a Pareto efficient context. The invisible hand first mention in Adam Smith’s “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations” would presumably cause the market to reach an equilibrium. Suppose there is an agent based world with apples and fish. Each agent has some variable number of these goods, and each agent have their individual indifference curve determining their utility. Each agent aims to trade goods in such a way where they maximize their utility. The number of agents will be adjustable.
The simulation will be done many times with changing variables, is there a point where the exchange economy will not reach Pareto efficiency? Since the agents can only interact when they bump into each other when randomly moving around if the simulation is too crowded it is possible the agents will never, in a reasonable time frame, bump into another agent who they can trade with. In a sense the friction has become so great the market does not reach equilibrium.   
I also intend to simulate and observe how the stimulation reacts to shocks, how does the economy react to doubling the number of apples, or doubling the demand of fish? What happens when regions are introduced?
The simulation is intended to be a way for the user to visually see how the economy behaves, and how various factors affect it. Once the simulation is stopped the program will display graphs that show the economy over time. 

Attributes of Agents:
Good1 (apples)
Good2 (fish)
Utility function
Number of Agents bumped into

Attributes of the World:
Graphical simulation
Total Utility
Ability to introduce global shocks
Time progression (progress x steps, progress until stopped)
Display global data
Graphical User Interface

Interactions:
Each time a one agent bumps into another agent they can trade, a trade depends on the indifference curves of the agents. 

Every Time step:
Each agent takes a step in a random walk (on a square grid?) 
Any agents that bump into each other might trade 
Gather Data
Now update the display 

More options and functions if time allows 
Freeze and save a simulation 
Adjust distribution of goods
Adjust supply of goods
Adjust demand of goods
Skip ahead (progress 100 (adjustable) more steps, not 1 step at a time)
